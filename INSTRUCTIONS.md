## Planning and Thoughts

### WHY THUNKS?

In general, you could do `fetch` calls from your React components and just
render that data received from that call within your component. Straightforward
and to the point, right? Sure, but what if you need that same data somewhere
else? Or what if you need it again because your user comes back to this page in
a few seconds? And that list can go on.

To centralize the data and keep the flow of data moving only in one direction,
we utilize thunks to apply data we have received from outside out frontend React
application into our components in said application.

While we could do the data fetch in our component and then dispatch an action
creator from our component, we would still end up repeating that fetch code in,
possibly, a number of places. With thunks, we can move that logic somewhere
else, and just dispatch the thunk from our component instead. This allows for
cleaner, DRY-er code while also separating our concerns, making it easier to
test and ensure that our code, and in turn our application, works.

### Steps

In this lecture, we will:

0. Set up our servers
1. Install the `redux-thunk` middleware.
2. Import the `redux-thunk` middleware in our `src/store/index.js` file.
3. Add it to our store as a middleware function.
4. Write a thunk creator to handle the GET request.
5. Change the use of the action creator in the components to use our thunk
   creator instead.
6. Test it. Did it break?
7. Write a thunk creator to handle the POST request.
8. Change the use of the action creator in the components to use our thunk
   creator instead.
9. Test it. Did it break?
10. Clean up our code.

## 0. See the README in the backend directory for instructions

We can set up the backend server by following the setup instructions available
in the [backend README document][backend-readme].

Afterwards, we can set up our frontend environment by installing dependencies
in the frontend with `npm install` while we are in our `frontend` directory.

## 1. Install the `redux-thunk` middleware

```sh
npm install redux-thunk
```

## 2. Import `redux-thunk` in our `src/store/index.js` file

```js
// frontend/src/store/index.js
// ... other imports
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

// ... other code
```

## 3. Add it to our store as a middleware function

```js
// ... imports and reducer code

let enhancer;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const logger = require('redux-logger').default;
  const composeEnhancers =
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__({ trace: true }) || compose;
  enhancer = composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk, logger));
}
```

## 4. Write a thunk creator to handle the GET request.

```js
// frontend/src/store/articleReducer.js
export const fetchArticles = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/articles');
  const articles = await res.json();
  dispatch(getArticles(articles));
};
```

## 5. Change the use of the action creator in the components to use our thunk creator instead.

In this case, our change will be made in our `ArticleList` component.

```js
// frontend/src/components/ArticleList/index.js

// import { getArticles } from '../../store/articleReducer';
import { fetchArticles } from '../../store/articleReducer';

// ... some code

  dispatch(fetchArticles);

// ... more code
```

## 6. Test it. Did it break?

Check the functionality of the application.

* Is anything missing?
* What is different?
* What is different in the Redux DevTools?

## 7. Write a thunk creator to handle the POST request

```js
// frontend/src/store/articleReducer.js
export const writeArticle = (payload) => async (dispatch) => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/articles', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });
  const newArticle = await res.json();

  if (res.ok) {
    dispatch(addArticle(newArticle));
  }
  return newArticle;
};
```

## 8. Change the use of the action creator in the components to use our thunk creator instead.

In this case, our change will be made in our `ArticleInput` component.

```js
// frontend/src/components/ArticleInput.js
// import { addArticle } from '../../store/articleReducer';
import { writeArticle } from '../../store/articleReducer';

// ... some code

  const newArticle = {
    // id: nanoid(),
    title: title,
    body,
    imageUrl,
  };

  dispatch(writeArticle(payload));
```

## 9. Test it. Did it break?

Check the functionality of the application.

* Is anything missing?
* What is different?
* What is different in the Redux DevTools?
* What's happening in our backend?

## 10. Clean up our code.

Look for warnings and errors.
