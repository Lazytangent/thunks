# Express-Sequelize Backend

This file documents the API routes made available by running this server.

## Setup

To start, you'll need to install our backend dependencies. If you're in the root
of this project, you'll need to move (`cd`) into the backend directory, before
running `npm install`.

Then, you'll need to create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file
that's available in this directory. Be sure to create a password for your
database user.

Using `psql` in the terminal, create a user with a password and `createdb` that
matches the one described in the `.env` file. We'll be using `dotenv` with
`sequelize` to pass our environment variables declared in the `.env` to our
`sequelize` commands.

After quitting out of the `psql` instance, you can run the following commands to
finish database setup.

* `npx dotenv sequelize db:create`
* `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`
* `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`

Because we specified that the port for the backend should be `5000`, we will
need to set up the `proxy` key in our frontend `package.json` so that our
frontend can pass any `/api` calls to the backend server.

Place the following at the bottom of your `frontend/package.json` file.

```json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

## API Documentation

### `POST /api/test`

A test route to check that the request body is getting parsed correctly.

**Returns** a JSON response of the following format with the JSON payload sent
in the request built into the response as `req.body`:

}
```

### `GET /api/articles`

A route to fetch all the articles in the database.

**Returns** a JSON response of the array of articles fetched from the database.

### `POST /api/articles`

A route to create a new article in the database, if the payload sent passes
the validations.
